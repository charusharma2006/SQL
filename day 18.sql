-- truncate is a DDL statement  where as Delete is a DML statement 
-- no condition is given in truncate where as you can give conditions in delete statement 
-- in truncate we can not revert(roll back)  but in delete we can roll back

-- NOTE :
-- IN CASE : IF YOU HAVE EXECUTED ANY DDL STATEMENT YOU CAN NOT ROLL BACK 
-- OBJECTS (table): ARE STRUCTURE THAT IS USED TO STORE , MANAGE,REFER THE DATA
